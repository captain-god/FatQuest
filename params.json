{"name":"Fatquest","tagline":"A small game made in Flixel with FlashDevelop","body":"Welcome to the FatQuest site!\r\n\r\nThe Game\r\n----------------\r\n##[I cant embed flash objects, so you'll have to play here!](http://dougriss.com/games/fatquest.html)\r\n\r\nIn FatQuest, you are hungry. Insatiably hungry. So hungry, you decide to eat everything. So you embark on a quest to eat everything, and as you eat, you get fatter. The objective is to eat everything in a level, making sure to get the edibles in hard-to-reach locations before you're too fat to get them.\r\n\r\nAbout\r\n------------\r\nSo I was on YouCanMakeVideoGames.com and I was feeling inspired. The premise of \"pick a simple idea, make something playable and just tweak it\" was a strong tactic, as in little to no time at all, thanks to flixel, I had a player controlled blip running around in a circle on my screen. Then I needed something to do. I looked around, saw a carton of empty take away, said \"okay, the objective is to eat food. lots of food. Like think pac man\"\r\n\r\nAnd that evolved into \"eat food to get bigger\";\r\n..which evolved into \"eat food, get bigger, not too big though\";\r\n..which finally landed at \"eat food, get bigger, but try not to get so big that you cant fit through gaps to eat more food.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason I'm saying all this is because this game came out of literally nowhere. I wanted to make a game, so I did. If you can't find inspiration for something to do in your game, try just looking around. I also thought of a game where you have to blow leaves out of a driveway after watching a guy at my apartment complex blow leaves out of a driveway (riveting, I know). Ideas are all around you, you just gotta get creative.\r\n\r\nSo let this be a lesson to you, mates - *you can make video games, too*. You just need to do it. The prototype of this game (two levels and the start screen) took me about 5 hours of just typing, running, googling and tweaking. Now that I know the way around the IDE, the language and the library, I could probably do it again in 2 hours. Experiment, have fun with it, and make some goddamn games ;)\r\n\r\nThanks/Credits\r\n-----------\r\n[Flixel](http://flixel.org) - the game engine this is built on  \r\n[Flash Develop](http://www.flashdevelop.org/) - the IDE I'm using  \r\n[FlashGameDojo](http://flashgamedojo.com) - a bunch of cool tutorials and information that got me goin'  \r\n[SFXR](www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) - a small program that generates chiptune noises  \r\n[Google](http://google.com/) - Helped me loads, they don't get enough credit  \r\n[Chaotic Neutral](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNz5nxTt0r64Wjg7HfkebAg) - My Let's Play channel I have with some close friends, who are lovely, encouraging people.
