<p>In FatQuest, you are hungry. Insatiably hungry. So hungry, you decide to eat everything. So you embark on a quest to eat everything, and as you eat, you get fatter. The objective is to eat everything in a level, making sure to get the edibles in hard-to-reach locations before you're too fat to get them.</p>

<p>So I was on YouCanMakeVideoGames.com and I was feeling inspired. The premise of "pick a simple idea, make something playable and just tweak it" was a strong tactic, as in little to no time at all, thanks to flixel, I had a player controlled blip running around in a circle on my screen. Then I needed something to do. I looked around, saw a carton of empty take away, said "okay, the objective is to eat food. lots of food. Like think pac man"</p>

<p>And that evolved into "eat food to get bigger";
..which evolved into "eat food, get bigger, not too big though";
..which finally landed at "eat food, get bigger, but try not to get so big that you cant fit through gaps to eat more food."</p>

<p>The reason I'm saying all this is because this game came out of literally nowhere. I wanted to make a game, so I did. If you can't find inspiration for something to do in your game, try just looking around. I also thought of a game where you have to blow leaves out of a driveway after watching a guy at my apartment complex blow leaves out of a driveway (riveting, I know). Ideas are all around you, you just gotta get creative.</p>

<p>So let this be a lesson to you, mates - <em>you can make video games, too</em>. You just need to do it. The prototype of this game (two levels and the start screen) took me about 5 hours of just typing, running, googling and tweaking. Now that I know the way around the IDE, the language and the library, I could probably do it again in 2 hours. Experiment, have fun with it, and make some goddamn games ;)</p>
