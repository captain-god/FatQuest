# FatQuest
A small game made in Flixel with FlashDevelop

So I was on YouCanMakeVideoGames.com and I was feeling inspired. The premise of "pick a simple idea, make something playable and just tweak it" was a strong tactic, as in little to no time at all, thanks to flixel, I had a blip running around in a circle. Then I needed something to do. I looked around, saw a carton of empty take away, said "okay, the objective is to eat food. lots of food. Like think pac man"

And that evolved into "eat food to get bigger";
which evolved into "eat food, get bigger, not too big though";
which finally landed at "eat food, get bigger, but try not to get so big that you cant fit through gaps to eat more food."

And here we are.
-----------------------
So let this be a lesson to you, mates - *you can make video games, too*. You just need to do it. The prototype of this game (Level one and the start screen) took me about 5 hours of just typing, running, googling and tweaking. Now that I know the way around the IDE, the language and the library, I could probably do it again in 2 hours. Experiment, have fun with it, etc etc.
